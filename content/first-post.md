Summary: Short introduction on why this blog is setup.
Status: published

Most of the time, I discover something, either from the Internet or listening to smart people like yourself, mainly in the field of software engineering. Those knowledge just got washed away. Before you know, I have to re-Google it or ask the guy again to explain it to me. Thus, I will try to use this as a way to share that knowledge to others. If you can find a way to re-explain what you don't know to other people in a simplified manner, I think it means that you got it.

From time to time, I will also cover topics related to data science, which I am quite fond of. Actually, not really data science as they call it right now, perhaps. I just like to tell story with data. You can tell so much, with data presented in a nice fancy visualization.
